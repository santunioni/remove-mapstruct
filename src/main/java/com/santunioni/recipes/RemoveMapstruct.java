/**
 * RemoveMapstruct is a recipe designed to refactor Mapstruct mapper interfaces.
 * <p>
 * It replaces @Mapper interfaces with their associated generated implementation. This process
 * includes managing necessary imports, removing @Override annotations from methods, and renaming
 * the generated implementation class to match the original mapper interface name.
 * <p>
 * The recipe performs the following key steps:
 * 1. Identifies classes annotated with Mapstruct's @Mapper annotation.
 * 2. Locates the corresponding Mapstruct-generated implementation class (e.g., `MyMapperImpl`) from the source files
 * in context.
 * 3. Merges imports from the original interface into the implementation class.
 * 4. Removes unnecessary annotations (such as @Override from methods and @Generated from classes) from the
 * implementation class.
 * 5. Renames the implementation class to match the original interface name and removes
 * "implements" declarations.
 * <p>
 * This recipe assumes that the generated implementation is available in the source files being processed.
 * The gradle plugin should be configured to include generated sources in the context.
 * <p>
 * Note: This recipe copies default methods, static methods, and static fields from the interface to the
 * implementation class, removing the default modifier and preserving the static modifier.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to run supplementary cleanup tools or recipes (e.g., RemoveUnusedImports)
 * following this recipe to handle any redundant imports or formatting inconsistencies introduced during the process.
